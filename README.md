# Stake

Inception: 03.08.17

Stake holds you and your team accountable to achieving your goals.

By placing a stake into a contract, the only way to recoup your ether is to meet your goals & have your teammates validate your progress.

Stake is developed through the Truffle framework, and leverages name registry and multi-signature capabilities via smart contract.

## Motivation for Stake

It took self-awareness to realise my subtle form of procrastination.
By "being in motion" as opposed to "taking action" ([James Clear](http://jamesclear.com/taking-action)), I was no closer to achieving my goals than I was X days ago.
I *really* wanted to learn dapp development by building an app that would stop me from procrastinating.

I formed an accountability group with my peers.
Every week, we assess each others' progress and set goals (in measurable, actionable units) for the coming week.
During assessment, we provide evidence of our progress to our members.
If we fail the assessment, we are "punished" for not doing so.
For example, I would send X ether to the contract & if I completed my weekly tasks:
  * I initiate a withdrawal process, and upon team confirmation, I can be refunded my ether
  * Otherwise, I would not recoup my stake (team would not consent to withdrawal); stake stays in team contract.

Initially, I looked at implementations of name registries & multi-sig wallets.
Tutorials were either too simplistic or too complex.
I decided to start small & build up the features I needed, thereby expanding my working knowledge.
As of 03.12.17, I have formed the barebones foundation; I've met one of my goals for the week.
I am learning a lot & regularly document my progress and code.
I hope novices, like me, can learn from this repo.
Also, once complete, I believe this platform will help people achieve their goals & realise a potential previously deemed inaccessible.
I appreciate any feedback & contributions - thank you in advance.

**Here's to taking action, getting things done, and raising the bar.**

## Learning Goals of Stake

* Comfort with solidity & truffle
* Develop UI for contracts
* Contract Testing
* Event Logging
* Multi contract interaction

## Learn as Dev

Important Files
* contracts/StakeOne.sol
  * StakeOne, registerMember, getMembers, changeRequirement, depositStake, getBalance, getCurrentWithdrawal, proposeWithdrawal, confirmWithdrawal, executeWithdrawal
* test/TestStakeOne.js
* app/javascripts/app.js
* migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js

Run
* `npm i`
* `testrpc`
* `rm -rf build/ && truffle compile && truffle migrate && truffle console`
* `npm run dev`

Test
* `testrpc`
* `truffle test ./test/JS_FILE`

## General To Do

Contracts
* Break up monolith contract & modularise w/ TDD
  * import/inherit from utility contracts, set dependencies/deployment correctly
  * CMC Doug? [Monax: 5 Types Tutorial 1](https://monax.io/docs/tutorials/solidity/solidity_1_the_five_types_model/)
  * [Monax: Action Driven Architecture Tutorial 2](https://monax.io/docs/tutorials/solidity/solidity_2_action_driven_architecture)
  * [Monax: Modular Solidity Tutorial 5](https://monax.io/docs/tutorials/solidity/solidity_5_modular_solidity/)
* Encapsulation (coupling, private)
* Current implementation enables DoS attack by never reaching required confirmations
  * [Ethereum Alarm Clock](http://www.ethereum-alarm-clock.com/)
* Many recurrent withdrawals vs. using finite state machine to manage one?
  * Assumes contract interaction during team meeting
* Oraclise through Google Spreadsheets?

UI
* React?
  * Update table on successful registry
* Authenticate via MetaMask
* Show currentWithdrawal
* Aesthetics

Testing
* Call vs. TXs
* Leverage events to debug & log testing process
  * [Solidity Docs: Events](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html#events)
* Usage of "contracts()" ("description" Ã  la truffle - clean slate)
* [Truffle Docs: JS Tests](http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/javascript-tests)

## 03.19.17

Completed
* Include more tests for multi-sig functionality

Learned
* [Consensys: Intro to Events & Logs](https://media.consensys.net/technical-introduction-to-events-and-logs-in-ethereum-a074d65dd61e#.80bgdzgm8)
  * Return Value for FrontEnd UI
  * Async Triggers w/ Data
  * Cheaper Form of Storage

Questions
* How to run tests w/o having to restart testrpc?

Next
* Test edge cases (states & requirements & registry & numConfirm)
* Implement event watchers in tests & frontend

## 03.18.17

Completed
* Update contract so register via owner or member (memberOrOwner modifier)
* Update deployment, run script that:
  * Sends Ether to MM address (hardcoded)
  * Registers MM address (hardcoded) from testrpc accounts[0] (owner)
  * [Truffle Docs: Deployment](http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/migrations#deployer-deploy-contract-args-options-)
* Update testing, use promises

Learned
* Customisation of deployment using promises
* Test using promises (return - no callback hell/nesting)

Questions
* When running tests, do the contracts get deployed based on 2_deploy_contracts?

Next
* Show currentWithdrawal at top of UI
* Update contract commenting
* Finish testing all functions
* Contract factory for teams
* getMembers() - format as table
* executeWithdrawal() (app.js broken; truffle console ok)

## 03.16.17

Tasks Completed
* Updated gitignore w/ ignore directory
* StakeOne inherits from Mortal (owned, onlyOwner, kill)

Learned
* Git pull ? `npm i` : (*facepalm*)
* Inheritance (if A.sol)
  * Import "path_to_file"
  * contract A is B {}
  * Migrating A? Truffle automatically includes B

To Do
* Split into NameReg & MultiSig, but ensure compatibility
* Callback Hell (Tests) --- _Updated 03.18.17_
* Pre & post modifiers
  * Implement a test contract (.sol) - [Androlo: Contract Oriented Programming](https://github.com/androlo/solidity-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/2016-07-02-contract-oriented-programming-II.md)
* Encapsulations (private/public)

## Lessons Learned (Before 03.16.17)
* Mapping pros & cons
  * KV store
  * Can't iterate easily
  * Mapping vs. Array
* Easy contract interaction via abstraction
  * No more hard coding address & ABI
* Running app within window.App & using window.web3
* web3.toAscii(bytes32)
* Deployment can take arguments; useful for contract constructors
* Testing: return something, .then()
  * [Chai: JS Tests](http://chaijs.com/api/assert/)
  * TDD should guide & verify development
  * Use console for quick checks
* Sending message (not TX) from contract to EOA (send ether)
* Monolith arises quickly
  * Learn to modularize contracts
  * Design before implementation - in this case, I wanted to learn by doing, was not focused on scalability
* Many ways to implement contracts
  * NameReg, Multi-sig, etc.
  * **Crucial to define scope & requirements** of users
* Exposed to many new concepts
  * Learn by doing
  * Find circle of competence & spiral outward from there
  * Trouble implementing? Google, docs, community
    * Should have a clear vision of what you want to implement
* Design decisions
  * Choosing a data structure over another (cost-benefit analysis)
  * Contracts are expensive! Ethereum is built for redundancy - keep only core code in contracts
* Finite state machine
* Deploys from web3.eth.accounts[0] automatically
